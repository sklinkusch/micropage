This is a "thank you" page for the local employment agency case manager to send me to the Digital Career Institute. It was created by Stefan Klinkusch at Digital Career Institute in August 2018 using HTML5 and CSS3.

It features

- a background image
- Google Fonts
- a CSS animation (changing colors in the thank you message)
